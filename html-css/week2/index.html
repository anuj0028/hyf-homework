         <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
         <p>
            Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry.
            The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
            services to customers. [1]
         </p>
         <p>
            There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, Glassfish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
            PHP) stack and Perl/Plack.
            This has the kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
            growth of the industry has been
            rise of the easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
            Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of
            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but
            the basics can be learned and
            implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face
            training.
         </p>
         <p>
            An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive
            websites.
            Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only
            available as application on a
            desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media
            distribution. Examples can be seen
            with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web services
            allow user to interact with
            applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application
            environment.

         <h3>Web Develpoment As An INDUSTRY</h3>
         <p>
            Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include
            e-commerce.
            Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services.
            Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and
            bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.
